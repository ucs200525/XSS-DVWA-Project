XSS Prevention Techniques

1. Validate User Input

    Only allow safe characters and formats (like email, numbers).
    Block unexpected HTML tags, scripts, and special characters.

2. Escape Data Before Displaying

    Convert special characters to safe codes (`<` → `&lt;`) before showing on the web page.
    Use proper encoding based on context: HTML, JavaScript, or URLs.

3. Use a Strong Content Security Policy (CSP)

    Add CSP headers to control which scripts can run on your website.
    Block inline scripts and disallow unknown sources.

4. Secure Cookies

    Set cookies with `HttpOnly` so JavaScript can't read them.
    Add `Secure` and `SameSite` attributes to limit cookie misuse.

5. Use Safe Frontend Frameworks

    Frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue auto-escape output to block XSS.
    Avoid turning off their built-in protections.

6. Clean User-Generated HTML

    Use libraries like `DOMPurify` to safely filter user-submitted HTML content.
    Don’t trust raw HTML from users.

7. Avoid Unsafe JavaScript Methods

    Don’t use `innerHTML`, `eval()`, `document.write()` unless absolutely needed.
    Use `textContent`, `createElement`, and other safer alternatives.

8. Test Your Site for Vulnerabilities

    Regularly scan your app with tools like:
      Burp Suite
      OWASP ZAP
      Browser Dev Tools
